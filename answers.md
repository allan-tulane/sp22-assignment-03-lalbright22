Work Recurrence: W(n) = W(n-1) + 1
Span Recurrence: S(n) = S(n-1) + 1

The big O notation is O(n)

Iterate is strictly sequential and has linear work and span.



- **d.**
Work Reccurence: W(n) = 2W(n/2) + 1
  big O notation is O(n)

Span Reccurence: S(n) = S(n/2) + 1
  big O notation is O(lg n)




- **f.**
